# Huge Discord.PY Bot Template for Beginners
A big Discord Python Bot with kick, ban, unmute, mute, unban, userinfo, hi, ping and other commands!

## How to setup?
This is explained quickly.
Go to [Discord Developers](http://discord.com/developers) and make an app, then a bot. Invite it to your server. Copy the token, don't share it with anybody!
Open the config.json file in this app and put your bot's token that you copied earlier in the ending: TOKEN="Put here!"
Now launch the file via CMD or other service.
Boom! It's on.
